"""The object of this one is to take a line of numbers in the format: (result: # # # # .. to the nth pos)the operators
are missing, the current operators in question are + and *. the values cannot be rearranged and the operands can be entered
in any space to try and achieve the result. the operations occor from right to left only so the order of operations
is out. so 5+15*2 would boil down to 20*2=40" not 35
Problem1: how many different ways can the result be achieved with the numbers in question?
some can be achieved multiple ways making it more problematic.
